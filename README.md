# ChIP-seq

All ChIP-seq data were processed according to the ENCODE3 ChIP-seq pipeline (https://www.encodeproject.org/chip-seq/), and mapped to hg19; all data passed ENCODE quality standards. ChIP-seq peaks were called using MACS2 (https://github.com/taoliu/MACS), followed by identifying common peaks between duplicates using IDR (https://github.com/nboley/idr).
